# Personal Budget App - Final Project

## Aiden James 801233865

I am using bulma as a simple CSS framework to make this app look presentable. I chose to use firebase for the auth and database because I have used it before. I chose Python Flask because I know it pretty well and I have used pytest before. Angular felt more organized to me while I took this class so I thought it would be easier to use for this final project.
