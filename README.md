# Personal Budget App - Final Project

## Aiden James 801233865

I am using bulma as a simple CSS framework to make this app look presentable. I chose to use firebase for the auth and database because I have used it before. I chose Python Flask because I know it pretty well and I have used pytest before. Angular felt more organized to me while I took this class so I thought it would be easier to use for this final project.

I chose to host this on a fedora droplet as fedora is what I use for my laptop and it would replicate the conditions I had when I made it. I know we were taught how to use Centos7, the old downstream of RHEL, and Fedora is an upstream of it, in fact even more upstream than centos. However I still think the tradeoff for this assignment is worth it since I have verified on my machine that it works.
